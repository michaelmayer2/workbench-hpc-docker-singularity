# This file contains entries that specify which versions of R are available for sessions to use.
#
# Each entry consists of four fields: Path, Label, Module, and Script, each separated
# by a new line.
#
# Each entry MUST be separated by ONE blank line (2 new line characters).
#
# Path is the location of the R installation. It is a required field.
#
# Label is a user-friendly version moniker for the particular R version. It is optional.
#
# Module is an environment module (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Modules_(software))
# to load when the particular version of R is loaded. It is optional. The command "module" must be
# available, and is attempted to be sourced from the user's .bashrc file.
#
# Script is the location of an executable script to run before the session is started.
# You can use the script to set up the environment how it needs to be before the session is run.
# Common uses include overriding any necessary environment variables, such as LD_LIBRARY_PATH or PATH.
#
# You can also simply specify the path to the R installation without any field information.
# That will cause the R installation to be loaded with default values for its environment,
# and will not contain a label. This is a good enough in most cases. These should be separated by 
# a blank line from the entries containing labels, but subsequent entries should not be separated 
# by additional blank lines. See the examples below for clarification.
#
# Examples are below. You can uncomment them to use them.
#
#Path: /opt/R/R-2.15.3
#Label: My special R Version
#Module: testmodule
#Script: ~/rload.sh
